    <td rowspan="3" valign="top"><p><strong>Blu-ray</strong>, also known as Blu-ray Disc (BD), is the name of a  next-generation optical disc format jointly developed by the Blu-ray  Disc Association (BDA), a group of the world's leading consumer  electronics, personal computer and media manufacturers (including  Apple, Dell, Hitachi, HP, JVC, LG, Mitsubishi, Panasonic, Pioneer,  Philips, Samsung, Sharp, Sony, TDK and Thomson). The format was  developed to enable recording, rewriting and playback of  high-definition video (HD), as well as storing large amounts of data.  The format offers more than five times the storage capacity of  traditional DVDs and can hold up to 25GB on a single-layer disc and  50GB on a dual-layer disc. This extra capacity combined with the use of  advanced video and audio codecs will offer consumers an unprecedented  HD experience. <br />
        <br />
        While current optical disc technologies such as DVD,  DVD&plusmn;R, DVD&plusmn;RW, and DVD-RAM rely on a red laser to read and write data,  the new format uses a blue-violet laser instead, hence the name  Blu-ray. Despite the different type of lasers used, Blu-ray products  can easily be made backwards compatible with CDs and DVDs through the  use of a BD/DVD/CD compatible optical pickup unit. The benefit of using  a blue-violet laser (405nm) is that it has a shorter wavelength than a  red laser (650nm), which makes it possible to focus the laser spot with  even greater precision. This allows data to be packed more tightly and  stored in less space, so it's possible to fit more data on the disc  even though it's the same size as a CD/DVD. This together with the  change of numerical aperture to 0.85 is what enables Blu-ray Discs to  hold 25GB/50GB. <br />
        <br />
Blu-ray is currently supported by more than 170 of the  world's leading consumer electronics, personal computer, recording  media, video game and music companies. The format also has broad  support from the major movie studios as a successor to today's DVD  format. Seven of the eight major movie studios have already announced  titles for Blu-ray, including Warner, Paramount, Fox, Disney, Sony, MGM  and Lionsgate. The initial line-up is expected to consist of over 100  titles and include recent hits as well as classics such as Batman  Begins, Desperado, Fantastic Four, Fifth Element, Hero, Ice Age, Kill  Bill, Lethal Weapon, Mission Impossible, Ocean's Twelve, Pirates of the  Caribbean, Reservoir Dogs, Robocop, and The Matrix. Many studios have  also announced that they will begin releasing new feature films on  Blu-ray Disc day-and-date with DVD, as well as a continuous slate of  catalog titles every month.</p>

          <td><p> Yes, that's the expectation. The Blu-ray format has received broad support from the major  			movie studios as a successor to today's DVD format. Seven of the eight major movie studios  			have already announced titles for Blu-ray, including Warner, Paramount, Fox, Disney, Sony, MGM  			and Lionsgate.

                <br />
            However, the two formats (Blu-ray and DVD) will most likely co-exist for quite some time  			until HDTVs become more widespread. For a complete list of the announced movies, please see our <a href="http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/">Blu-ray Movies</a> section. </p></td>

In fact, most of the Blu-ray players coming out will support upscaling of DVDs to 1080p/1080i, so your  			existing DVD collection will look even better than before. While it's up to each manufacturer to decide  			if they want to make their products backwards compatible with DVD, the format is far too popular to not  			be supported. The Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA) expects every Blu-ray Disc device to be backward  			compatible with DVDs. </p></td>

          <td><p> The simple answer is HDTV. If you've  ever seen high-definition (HD) video on an HDTV, then you know just how  incredibly sharp the picture is and how vivid the colors are. In fact,  HD offers five times the amount of detail compared to  standard-definition (SD). The problem with today's DVDs is that they  only support SD and don't have the necessary storage capacity to  satisfy the needs of HD. That's where Blu-ray comes in, it offers up to  50GB of storage capacity and enables playback, recording and rewriting  of HD in all of the HD resolutions including 1080p. The format also  supports high-definition audio formats and lossless audio. <br />
                <br />
            In addition to the greater video and audio quality, the  extra storage capacity also means there will be plenty of room for  additional content and special features. This combined with the new  BD-J interactivity layer adopted by Blu-ray will bring the menus,  graphics and special features to a whole new level. For example, you  will be able to bring up the menu system as an overlay without stopping  the movie, and you could have the director of the movie on the screen  explaining the shooting of a scene while the scene is playing in the  background. The advanced interactivity combined with the networking  features of Blu-ray will also allow content producers to support new  innovative features such as downloading extras, updating content via  the web, and watching live broadcasts of special events. <br />
            <br />
            Thanks to the greatly enhanced HD video and audio quality  as well as the advanced interactivity and networking features, Blu-ray  represents a huge leap forward in the DVD viewing experience and will  offer consumers an unprecedented HD experience. </p></td>
